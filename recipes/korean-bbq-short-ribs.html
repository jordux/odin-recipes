    <h1>Korean BBQ Short Ribs</h1>
        <img src="../images/korean-bbq-ribs.jpeg" alt="Picture of finished Korean BBQ dish">
         <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.
         </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>3/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
             <li>3/4 cup water</li>
             <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
             <li>1/2 large onion, minced</li>
             <li>1/4 cup minced garlic</li>
             <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
             <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
             <li>3 pounds Korean-style short ribs</li>
         </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>
                 Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.
                </li>
             <li>
                 Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
                </li>
            <li>
                Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.
                </li>
            <li>
                Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
                </li>
         </ol>
